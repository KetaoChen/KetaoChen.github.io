## 1. [SpaceX Acquires xAI in Landmark $1.25 Trillion Merger](https://www.thehindu.com/news/morning-digest-february-3-2026/article70585840.ece)

Elon Musk's SpaceX has acquired his AI startup xAI in what becomes the largest private company merger in history. The combined entity is valued at approximately $1.25 trillion, making it the world's most valuable private company. The deal unifies SpaceX's rocket-and-satellite operations with xAI's Grok chatbot and AI infrastructure ahead of SpaceX's anticipated 2026 IPO.

**Why it matters:** This consolidation signals Musk's ambition to build space-based AI data centers and integrate AI deeply into satellite communications—a potential game-changer for both industries.

## 2. [Google DeepMind Open-Sources AlphaGenome for DNA Function Prediction](https://medium.com/last-week-in-ai/last-week-in-ai-february-2-2026-fe43afefc73b)

Following the Nobel Prize-winning success of AlphaFold for protein structure prediction, Google DeepMind unveiled AlphaGenome—a new AI model that predicts the function of DNA sequences. The model has been fully open-sourced, making it freely available to researchers worldwide for genomics research.

**Why it matters:** This represents another major leap in AI-driven biology, potentially accelerating drug discovery and our understanding of genetic diseases.

## 3. [OpenAI Retiring GPT-4o, Pushing Users to GPT-5.2](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/bye-bye-chatgpt-4o-openai-retires-several-models-pushes-us-to-use-new-gpt-5-ones/)

OpenAI announced it will retire GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o4-mini, and older GPT-5 variants on February 13, 2026, pushing all users to migrate to GPT-5.2. The deprecation affects millions of API users and ChatGPT subscribers who must update their integrations before the cutoff date.

**Why it matters:** The aggressive deprecation timeline shows OpenAI's confidence in GPT-5.2 and signals the rapid pace at which frontier models are becoming obsolete—a challenge for enterprises building on these APIs.

## 4. [Waabi Raises $750M for Autonomous Trucking, Partners with Uber for Robotaxis](https://techstartups.com/2026/02/02/top-startup-and-tech-funding-news-february-2-2025/)

Toronto-based Waabi secured a record-breaking $750 million Series C—the largest tech fundraising in Canadian history. The round includes a strategic partnership with Uber to power 25,000+ robotaxis. Investors include Khosla Ventures, G2 Venture Partners, NVIDIA's NVentures, BlackRock, and Uber itself.

**Why it matters:** Waabi's "Physical AI" approach—using a unified AI brain that can drive different vehicles across varied geographies—could finally crack the autonomous vehicle scaling problem that has stymied the industry.

## 5. [Microsoft Unveils Maia 200 AI Inference Chip](https://insidehpc.com/2026/02/hpc-news-bytes-20260202-microsofts-inference-chip-h200-not-h20-for-china-mega-ai-data-center-deals/)

Microsoft launched its second-generation in-house AI chip, Maia 200, focused on AI inference workloads. The chip comes with comprehensive software tools designed to challenge NVIDIA's developer ecosystem dominance. This follows Azure's strategy to reduce dependence on external chip suppliers.

**Why it matters:** As AI inference costs become a major concern, Microsoft building its own silicon—combined with software tools—represents serious competition for NVIDIA's datacenter business.
