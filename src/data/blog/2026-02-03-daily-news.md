## 1. [OpenAI Seeks Alternatives to Nvidia for Inference Chips](https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-is-unsatisfied-with-some-nvidia-chips-looking-alternatives-sources-say-2026-02-02/)

OpenAI is dissatisfied with some of Nvidia's latest AI chips and has been seeking alternatives since last year, according to eight sources familiar with the matter. The ChatGPT-maker's shift in strategy focuses on chips used for AI inference—the process when an AI model responds to customer queries. While Nvidia remains dominant in training chips, inference has become a new competitive front. OpenAI has explored deals with AMD, Cerebras, and Groq, though Nvidia's $20 billion licensing deal with Groq shut down OpenAI's talks with that startup.

**Why it matters:** This marks a significant test of Nvidia's AI dominance and comes as the two companies are in investment talks over Nvidia's planned $100 billion investment in OpenAI, which has been delayed for months.

The 2026 International AI Safety Report, chaired by Turing Award-winner Yoshua Bengio and backed by over 30 countries, was released today. Key findings include: AI systems achieved gold-medal performance on International Math Olympiad questions and exceeded PhD-level performance on science benchmarks; at least 700 million people now use leading AI systems weekly; deepfake incidents are rising, with AI-generated non-consensual intimate imagery increasingly common; and malicious actors actively use AI in cyberattacks, with underground marketplaces selling pre-packaged AI tools.

**Why it matters:** The report provides decision-makers with rigorous evidence to steer AI development, highlighting both rapid capability improvements and emerging risks that require stronger safeguards.

## 3. [Palantir Beats Q4 Earnings on Strong AI and Defense Demand](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/02/palantir-pltr-q4-2025-earnings.html)

Palantir reported Q4 earnings of 25 cents per share (vs. 23 cents expected) and revenue of $1.41 billion (vs. $1.33 billion expected), representing 70% year-over-year growth. The AI-powered software provider's fiscal 2026 revenue guidance of $7.18-7.20 billion implies 61% topline growth, crushing Wall Street's 43% estimate. CEO Alex Karp called the results "indisputably the best results that I'm aware of in tech in the last decade." U.S. commercial customers grew from 14 five years ago to 571 today.

**Why it matters:** Palantir's explosive growth demonstrates surging enterprise demand for AI tools, with the company's AIP bootcamp model enabling businesses and government agencies to rapidly deploy AI solutions.
