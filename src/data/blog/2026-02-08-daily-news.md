## 1. [US Companies Accused of 'AI Washing' to Justify Layoffs](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/08/ai-washing-job-losses-artificial-intelligence)

Economists and analysts are pushing back on corporate claims that AI is driving mass layoffs. In 2025, AI was cited as the reason for over 54,000 job cuts, but experts argue the real drivers are tariffs, post-pandemic overhiring, and profit maximization. Companies like Amazon and HP have blamed AI for workforce reductions, but critics say the technology isn't mature enough to replace workers at the scale being claimed.

**Why it matters:** "AI washing" — using AI as cover for layoffs driven by other factors — could distort public understanding of AI's actual impact on employment and inflate fears prematurely.

## 2. [AI Takes Center Stage at Super Bowl LX Commercials](https://www.filmogaz.com/140187)

Meta, Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic are all running AI-themed commercials during today's Super Bowl LX. Meta is promoting AI wearables with Spike Lee, Anthropic is running four ads for Claude, and Amazon is showcasing Alexa+. The AI ad blitz is drawing comparisons to crypto's Super Bowl moment in 2022 — which preceded the industry's collapse.

**Why it matters:** AI's dominance in the most expensive ad slots signals the technology has fully entered the consumer mainstream, though the crypto parallel raises questions about hype cycles.

## 3. [Jensen Huang: $660 Billion AI Investment Is Not a Waste](https://www.eteknix.com/jensen-huang-says-660-billion-ai-investment-is-not-a-waste/)

NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang defended the massive AI infrastructure spending by Big Tech (Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft — each exceeding $100B/year in capex). He argues AI has moved past the experimental stage, pointing to real revenue at OpenAI and Anthropic as proof of sustainability. Critics compare the spending to the dot-com "dark fiber" era.

**Why it matters:** Whether AI infrastructure spending is justified or a bubble is the defining investment question of 2026, and Huang — as the primary beneficiary — has the most to gain from continued spending.

## 4. [Anthropic Releases Claude Opus 4.6 with 'Agent Teams'](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/anthropic-releases-opus-4-6-with-new-agent-teams/)

Anthropic launched Opus 4.6, its latest flagship model, featuring "agent teams" — multiple agents that split tasks and coordinate in parallel. The model also doubles context to 1M tokens and adds a native PowerPoint integration. Head of Product Scott White says Opus has evolved from a coding specialist into a broader knowledge-worker tool.

**Why it matters:** Agent teams represent a shift from single-agent to multi-agent workflows, which could be the next major paradigm for enterprise AI adoption.

## 5. [AI Fear Grips Wall Street as Disruption Feels Imminent](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-fear-grips-wall-street-140007396.html)

Wall Street is increasingly anxious about AI-driven disruption across industries. Google's recent release of a tool that generates immersive digital worlds from text prompts rattled video-game stocks. The rapid pace of new tools from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google is making long-theorized disruption feel much more real and immediate.

**Why it matters:** The market is shifting from "AI as opportunity" to "AI as existential threat" for incumbents — a sentiment change that could reshape investment flows across sectors.
