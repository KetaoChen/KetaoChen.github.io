## 1. [Pentagon Threatens to Cut Off Anthropic Over AI Safeguards Dispute](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/15/claude-pentagon-anthropic-contract-maduro)

The Pentagon is considering severing its relationship with Anthropic after months of failed negotiations over how the military can use Claude. The DoD is pushing four AI companies to allow "all lawful purposes" usage — including weapons development, intelligence collection, and battlefield operations. While the other three companies have shown flexibility, Anthropic has refused to drop its safety guardrails. A senior administration official told Axios the Pentagon is "fed up."

**Why it matters:** This is the clearest clash yet between AI safety principles and government pressure to militarize AI. Anthropic's stance could become a defining moment for the industry's relationship with defense.

## 2. [Software Stocks Suffer Biggest Plunge in 30 Years as AI Disruption Fears Grow](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/14/business/dealbook/software-companies-ai.html)

Software stocks have lost $2 trillion in market cap from their peak, with the S&P North American Expanded Technology Software Index down ~20% in the past month alone. Salesforce and ServiceNow shares are down over 40% year-over-year. Companies at every stage are desperately rebranding as "AI companies" — sparkle emojis, .ai domains, and AI-first pitches are everywhere. The panic was amplified by Matt Shumer's viral essay "Something Big Is Happening," viewed 80M times on X.

**Why it matters:** The market is pricing in a world where AI agents replace traditional SaaS workflows. For enterprise software companies (including Glean's competitors), this is an existential reckoning.

## 3. [Altman, Pichai Head to India for AI Impact Summit 2026](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/16/india-ai-impact-summit-tech-ceos-new-delhi.html)

India is hosting the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi (Feb 16-20), drawing OpenAI's Sam Altman, Alphabet's Sundar Pichai, Anthropic's Dario Amodei, and DeepMind's Demis Hassabis. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang withdrew last-minute due to "unforeseen circumstances." PM Modi is positioning India as a major AI hub, with $18B in approved semiconductor projects. The summit comes amid a U.S.-India trade deal push.

**Why it matters:** India is making its biggest play yet to be an AI superpower — with 1.4B people, a massive talent pool, and every major AI CEO showing up, the geopolitical AI landscape is shifting.

## 4. [2026 AI Safety Report Triggers Expert Alarm on AI Risks](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/15/why-are-experts-sounding-the-alarm-on-ai-risks)

The newly published 2026 International AI Safety Report, chaired by Yoshua Bengio, details mounting risks from advanced AI systems. A wave of safety researchers have quit major AI companies in recent weeks, publicly warning about unchecked development. Bengio noted that "one year ago, nobody would have thought we would see the wave of psychological issues from people interacting with AI systems and becoming emotionally attached." The report adds urgency to regulation conversations even as billions flow into AI investments.

**Why it matters:** The safety community is fracturing — researchers are leaving companies they believe are moving too fast, while those companies raise record funding. The tension between safety and speed is reaching a breaking point.

## 5. [AI Disruption Fears Are Dominating Earnings Calls](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-15/ai-risk-is-dominating-conference-calls-as-investors-dump-stocks)

Bloomberg analysis shows mentions of "AI disruption" on management earnings calls nearly doubled compared to the previous quarter. Investors are dumping stocks across sectors — from drug distribution to commercial property to price comparison sites — as AI capabilities give credibility to predictions of mass white-collar job displacement. Oxford's Carl Benedikt Frey noted: "AI turns once-scarce expertise into output that's cheaper, faster, and increasingly comparable, which compresses margins long before whole jobs disappear."

**Why it matters:** AI anxiety has crossed from tech Twitter into boardrooms and earnings calls. When CFOs start talking about AI disruption risk, it signals the disruption narrative has gone mainstream.
