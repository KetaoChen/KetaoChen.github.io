## 1. [India AI Impact Summit Draws Global Tech Leaders to New Delhi](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/all-the-important-news-from-the-ongoing-india-ai-summit/)

India is hosting a four-day AI Impact Summit expecting 250,000 visitors, with executives from OpenAI, Anthropic, Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, and heads of state in attendance. Major announcements include India earmarking $1.1 billion for an AI-focused state-backed VC fund, Blackstone taking a majority stake in Indian AI startup Neysa with a $600M equity raise, and Anthropic opening its first India office in Bengaluru. Sam Altman revealed India now has over 100 million weekly active ChatGPT users, second only to the US.

**Why it matters:** The summit signals India's aggressive push to become a top-3 AI superpower, with massive capital commitments from both government and private sector flowing into AI infrastructure and startups.

## 2. [Infosys Partners with Anthropic to Build Enterprise AI Agents](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/as-ai-jitters-rattle-it-stocks-infosys-partners-with-anthropic-to-build-enterprise-grade-ai-agents/)

Indian IT giant Infosys announced a partnership with Anthropic to integrate Claude models into its Topaz AI platform, building agentic systems for enterprise workflows in banking, telecoms, and manufacturing. Infosys will also use Claude Code internally for software development. The deal comes as Indian IT stocks face pressure from fears that AI will disrupt the $280 billion IT services industry.

**Why it matters:** Rather than being disrupted by AI, major IT services firms are racing to partner directly with AI labs — a "if you can't beat them, join them" pivot that could reshape the entire outsourcing industry.

## 3. [Sony May Delay PS6 Launch to 2028-2029 as AI Devours Memory Chips](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/sony-may-push-ps6-launch-to-2028-or-even-2029-as-memory-chip-crisis-bites/amp_articleshow/128424286.cms)

The global memory chip shortage, driven by massive AI infrastructure buildouts, is reportedly pushing Sony's PlayStation 6 timeline to 2028 or even 2029. Advanced memory chips are being heavily diverted to AI hardware, giving the PS5 an unusually long life cycle and showing how the semiconductor race is rewriting product launch calendars across the tech industry.

**Why it matters:** AI's insatiable hardware appetite is now visibly impacting consumer electronics timelines — a concrete example of how AI infrastructure investment creates ripple effects across seemingly unrelated industries.
