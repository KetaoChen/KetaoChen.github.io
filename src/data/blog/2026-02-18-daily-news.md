## 1. [India's AI Impact Summit Hit by Robot Plagiarism Scandal](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/india-tells-university-leave-ai-summit-after-presenting-chinese-robot-its-own-2026-02-18/)

An Indian university was asked to vacate its stall at India's flagship AI Impact Summit after a professor was caught on state TV presenting a commercially available Chinese-made Unitree Go2 robotic dog (~$2,800) as the university's own creation. The video went viral, drawing sharp criticism and casting an uncomfortable spotlight on India's AI ambitions. The summit, running through Saturday in New Delhi, has been billed as the first major AI gathering hosted in the Global South.

**Why it matters:** The embarrassment undercuts India's credibility as it tries to position itself as a global AI leader, with PM Modi and world leaders like Macron in attendance.

## 2. [Google Announces I/O 2026 for May 19-20, Puts Gemini Front and Center](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/google-i-o-2026-leans-into-ai-heres-what-it-means-for-you/)

Google has set its annual developer conference for May 19-20 at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View. The save-the-date messaging positions Gemini as the central throughline, with Android, Chrome, and Google Cloud as the key surfaces for AI integration. Registration is now open.

**Why it matters:** Google is framing AI not as a side topic but as the connective layer across its entire platform — signaling deeper Gemini integration into developer tools and consumer products.

## 3. [Bond Markets Are Pricing In an AI Productivity Boom](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/bonds-swept-up-leap-faith-ai-productivity-2026-02-18/)

U.S. Treasury yields have slid to their lowest levels of the year, with Fed rate futures dipping below 3% for the first time in four months. Reuters analysis argues the move reflects growing market conviction that AI-driven productivity gains could justify deeper rate cuts — a "leap of faith" that goes beyond what recent employment or inflation data alone would support.

**Why it matters:** AI hype is now moving bond markets, not just equities — suggesting the macro consensus is shifting toward AI as a real deflationary force.

## 4. [BBC Investigation: "I Hacked ChatGPT and Google's AI in 20 Minutes"](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20260218-i-hacked-chatgpt-and-googles-ai-and-it-only-took-20-minutes)

A BBC journalist demonstrated how a single well-crafted blog post can manipulate what ChatGPT, Google AI search, and Gemini tell users — a form of "AI SEO" that's being exploited at massive scale. The investigation found dozens of examples of businesses and bad actors coercing AI tools into promoting products and spreading misinformation. Experts warn AI companies are "moving faster than their ability to regulate accuracy."

**Why it matters:** As AI search replaces traditional search for many users, the vulnerability to manipulation has serious implications for information integrity — from health advice to elections.

## 5. [Google Publishes 2026 Responsible AI Progress Report](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/products/responsible-ai-2026-report-ongoing-work/)

Google released its annual Responsible AI report, detailing how it operationalizes its AI Principles across the full lifecycle — from research and model development to post-launch monitoring. The report highlights the rise of agentic AI systems, advances in scientific discovery and healthcare, and the company's multi-layered governance approach as models become more capable and personalized.

**Why it matters:** As agentic AI systems become mainstream, Google's governance framework offers a benchmark — and a target for scrutiny — on how Big Tech approaches AI safety at scale.
