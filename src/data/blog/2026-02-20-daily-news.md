Sam Altman and Dario Amodei awkwardly raised fists instead of holding hands during a group photo at the India AI Summit, alongside PM Modi and Sundar Pichai. The rivalry has escalated recently, with Anthropic running Super Bowl ads mocking OpenAI's ad plans and OpenAI calling them "clearly dishonest."

The NYT reports on AI's growing role in U.S. midterm politics. OpenAI is backing a super PAC called "Leading the Future" with over $100M raised, while Anthropic countered with $20M into its own super PAC. Three political camps are emerging: AI accelerationists, safety-concerned moderates, and those focused on specific harms like deepfakes and AI companions for kids.

**Why it matters:** AI companies are now directly spending big on U.S. elections, marking a new era where AI policy becomes a central political battleground.
