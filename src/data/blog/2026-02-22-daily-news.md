## 1. [Sam Altman Calls Out 'AI Washing' — Says Companies Use AI as Excuse for Layoffs](https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/ai-vs-humans-sam-altman-says-some-companies-are-using-ai-as-excuse-to-fire-employees-2872340-2026-02-22)

At the India AI Impact Summit 2026, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman coined the term "AI washing" to describe companies blaming AI for layoffs that would have happened anyway. Altman said less than 1% of job losses actually trace back to AI, and that executives are invoking the technology to appear innovative while downsizing for unrelated financial reasons.

**Why it matters:** As AI anxiety grows, this framing from the CEO of the leading AI company pushes back on the narrative that AI is already causing mass unemployment — and puts the blame on corporate opportunism instead.

## 2. [Google VP Warns Two Types of AI Startups May Not Survive](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/21/google-vp-warns-that-two-types-of-ai-startups-may-not-survive/)

Darren Mowry, who leads Google's global startup organization, warned that LLM wrapper startups and AI aggregators have their "check engine light" on. Thin wrappers around GPT or Gemini with little proprietary value won't survive, he says, while deep-moat players like Cursor and Harvey AI will thrive. He also cautioned incoming startups to "stay out of the aggregator business."

**Why it matters:** A senior Google executive publicly signaling that the AI startup shakeout is underway — echoing early cloud computing consolidation patterns — is a strong market signal for founders and investors.

## 3. [China's Brain-Computer Interface Industry Is Racing Ahead](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/22/chinas-brain-computer-interface-industry-is-racing-ahead/)

While Neuralink grabs headlines, China's BCI sector is quietly scaling up. Multiple provinces have already set medical service pricing for BCI, speeding insurance coverage. Backed by an 11.6 billion yuan ($165M) brain science fund and a national roadmap targeting major milestones by 2027, startups like NeuroXess and Gestala are pushing both implantable and noninvasive BCIs toward commercialization.

**Why it matters:** China is building the regulatory and financial infrastructure to make BCI a mainstream medical technology — potentially leapfrogging the US approach of individual company breakthroughs.

## 4. [Former Intelligence Officer Warns Against Uploading Medical Data to Grok](https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/elon-musk-grok-ai-privacy-concerns-1780748)

After Elon Musk encouraged users to upload X-rays, MRIs, and other medical images to Grok for "second opinions," former intelligence officer Travis Akers issued a sharp warning: "Nobody should ever upload their medical information into an AI platform." Experts note that unlike hospitals, AI platforms aren't bound by medical privacy laws like HIPAA, and uploaded data could be stored indefinitely or breached.

**Why it matters:** The tension between AI's potential in healthcare and the complete absence of privacy protections for consumer AI health tools is a regulatory gap that will only grow as these features improve.
