## 1. [Anthropic Drops Flagship Safety Pledge](https://time.com/7380854/exclusive-anthropic-drops-flagship-safety-pledge/)

Anthropic is scrapping the central promise of its Responsible Scaling Policy — the commitment to never train an AI system unless safety mitigations were guaranteed in advance. Chief Science Officer Jared Kaplan told TIME that "it wouldn't actually help anyone for us to stop training AI models" while competitors blaze ahead. The new policy instead promises to match or surpass competitors' safety efforts and to delay development only if Anthropic is both the AI leader and sees significant catastrophe risk.

**Why it matters:** The most safety-conscious frontier lab just acknowledged that unilateral safety commitments are untenable in today's competitive landscape — a watershed moment for AI governance.

## 2. [Hegseth Gives Anthropic Until Friday to Remove Military AI Safeguards](https://www.reuters.com/business/hegseth-gives-anthropic-until-friday-back-down-ai-safeguards-axios-reports-2026-02-24/)

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has given Anthropic a Friday deadline to drop safeguards on its AI products used by the military, per Axios. The Pentagon wants both OpenAI and Anthropic's AI tools available on classified networks without the standard restrictions the companies normally apply to users.

**Why it matters:** The U.S. government is actively pressuring AI companies to remove safety guardrails for military use, raising fundamental questions about who controls AI safety standards.

## 3. ['A Feedback Loop With No Brake': AI Doomsday Report Shakes US Markets](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/feb/24/feedback-loop-no-brake-how-ai-doomsday-report-rattled-markets)

A viral scenario from Citrini Research — depicting AI agents causing 10%+ unemployment and an "Occupy Silicon Valley" movement by 2028 — rattled investors and contributed to a 1%+ S&P drop on Monday. Companies specifically named in the report, including Uber, American Express, Mastercard, and DoorDash, fell 4-6%. The software component of the S&P hit its lowest since Trump's 2025 "liberation day" tariffs.

**Why it matters:** Markets are increasingly jittery about AI disruption — even speculative doomsday scenarios can now move billions in market cap.

## 4. [Big Tech Will Only Partly Dissolve AI Water Risk](https://www.reuters.com/commentary/breakingviews/big-tech-will-only-partly-dissolve-ai-water-risk-2026-02-23/)

Despite Nvidia's Jensen Huang revealing that new Vera Rubin chips can be cooled with 45°C water (vs. the 6°C industry norm), Reuters Breakingviews argues that Big Tech's data center water problem is only partially solved. AI-driven growth could consume as much extra water annually by 2030 as all Americans currently drink, according to Ecolab estimates.

**Why it matters:** Even as chip-level cooling improves dramatically, the sheer scale of AI infrastructure means water sustainability remains a serious constraint on growth.
