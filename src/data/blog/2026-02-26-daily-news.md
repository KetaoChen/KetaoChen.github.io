## 1. [Anthropic CEO Refuses Pentagon's Demand for Unrestricted AI Access](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/tech-news-today-nvidia-earnings-on-deck-as-tech-stocks-rebound-anthropic-relieves-some-ai-fears-140009329.html)

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei issued a statement Thursday evening saying his company will not submit to the Department of Defense's demands to use its AI technology as it sees fit. The move draws a clear line between commercial AI companies and government military applications.

**Why it matters:** This sets a major precedent for how frontier AI labs navigate government pressure, and signals that not all companies will bend to national security demands for unrestricted AI access.

## 2. [Block Cuts 40%+ Workforce in Pivot to AI-Native Fintech](https://www.tipranks.com/news/company-announcements/block-restructures-workforce-to-become-ai-native-fintech)

Block (formerly Square) announced a sweeping workforce reduction, cutting headcount from over 10,000 to under 6,000 — a 40%+ reduction — as it restructures to become an "AI-native" fintech company. The move is one of the largest AI-driven layoffs to date.

**Why it matters:** This is the most aggressive AI-driven corporate restructuring yet, and likely a preview of what's coming across industries as companies bet that AI agents can replace large swaths of white-collar work.

## 3. [Nvidia Posts Record $68.1B Quarterly Revenue as AI Spending Surges](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2026)

Nvidia reported record Q4 revenue of $68.1 billion for the quarter ended January 25, 2026, confirming that enterprise demand for AI compute infrastructure remains intense despite growing investor debate about AI monetization timelines.

**Why it matters:** The numbers prove AI infrastructure spending hasn't peaked — but the real question is shifting from "will they buy GPUs" to "will the returns justify the investment."

## 4. [White House to Host Big Tech for AI Power-Cost Pledge](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/white-house-host-big-tech-pledge-rein-power-costs-2026-02-25/)

The White House announced it will host leading AI and data center companies on March 4 to formalize a "Rate Payer Protection Pledge," requiring tech companies to shoulder more of the electricity cost burden from AI infrastructure rather than passing it to households.

**Why it matters:** AI's next bottleneck isn't GPUs — it's electricity. This signals Washington is treating AI power demand as a public-interest issue, which could reshape where and how fast data centers get built.

## 5. [Thought Experiment Warns of AI-Driven Economic Upheaval by 2028](https://www.euronews.com/next/2026/02/26/ai-doomsday-new-thought-experiment-warns-of-social-and-economic-upheaval-by-2028)

A new paper by investment firm Citrini and AI entrepreneur Alap Shah envisions a "global intelligence crisis" by 2028, where AI-driven layoffs trigger a vicious cycle of unemployment, wage stagnation, and recession. The authors argue that each company's rational choice to adopt AI leads to a collectively catastrophic outcome.

**Why it matters:** With Block's 40% cuts announced the same day, this scenario feels less hypothetical — the paper frames the central tension of the AI transition: individual rationality vs. collective stability.
