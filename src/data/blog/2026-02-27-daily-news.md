## 1. [Trump Orders Federal Agencies to Stop Using Anthropic Over AI Safety Dispute](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/27/trump-anthropic-ai-federal-agencies)

Trump directed all federal agencies to "immediately cease" use of Anthropic's AI technology after the company refused to lift safety guardrails for the Pentagon. The Department of Defense had demanded unfettered access to Claude for military applications, but Anthropic resisted allowing its AI to be used for mass surveillance or autonomous weapons systems without human oversight.

**Why it matters:** This is a landmark clash between government power and AI safety principles, setting a precedent for how far companies can push back on military AI use.

## 2. [Block Cuts 40% of Workforce, Jack Dorsey Says AI Makes Smaller Teams More Capable](https://www.dailybreeze.com/2026/02/27/financial-markets-ai/)

Jack Dorsey announced Block (parent of Cash App and Square) is cutting over 4,000 jobs — nearly half its workforce — despite a strong 2025. Dorsey said "intelligence tools have changed what it means to build and run a company" and predicted most companies will reach the same conclusion within a year. Block's stock jumped 16.8% on the news.

**Why it matters:** The largest AI-driven layoff to date signals that AI workforce displacement is accelerating from fear to corporate reality.

## 4. [AI Industry Super PACs Flooding 2026 Midterms with Tens of Millions](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2026-election/ads-ai-industry-are-flooding-2026-election-artificial-intelligence-rcna260782)

Competing super PACs backed by OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, Andreessen Horowitz, and Anthropic's Dario Amodei are pouring millions into 2026 primaries — but their ads focus on immigration, healthcare, and other hot-button issues rather than AI policy. Leading the Future, the pro-OpenAI PAC, had $39 million banked at year-end.

**Why it matters:** AI companies are now major political players, spending big to shape regulation through proxy issues rather than direct AI policy debate.
